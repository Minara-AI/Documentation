### Get Ready: Deposit Funds

If you don’t know how to deposit USDC, check this guide: [how-to-deposit-funds.md](how-to-deposit-funds.md "mention"). Please note that USDC is used as the base currency for trading.

For stock trading, only tokenized stocks are supported now — “stock” below refers specifically to stock tokens.

{% hint style="info" %}
A **stock token** is a digital version of a company's stock on a blockchain. Here's how it works:

1. **Price Tracking**: Its value mirrors with the real stock's market price.
2. **Dividends**: Tokens usually pay dividends like stocks. Some don't—check the token's rules.
3. **No Voting Rights**: Unlike stocks, most tokens don't give you the right to vote in company decisions.
