### Why Minara?

The digital finance is gaining significant influence—but also more complex. As on-chain ecosystems evolve at lightning speed and crypto wallets remain clunky and unintuitive, the entry barrier for newcomers stays high.

That's why Minara is here: **we need a brand new AI-powered interface that replaces complexity with chatting and brings everyone into the on-chain world—regardless of background or skill.**
