# Discover: Crypto Picks

**Crypto Picks** is designed to help users track evolving trends, evaluate market confidence, and manage risk exposure through structured, explainable signals.

***

### Purpose and Scope

Crypto Picks is designed for short-term market monitoring (12 h – 1 week horizon).

It does not cover long-term valuation or fundamental analysis but focuses on **trend momentum, sentiment shifts, and risk control**.

Together, the Bullish and Bearish Boards provide a consolidated snapshot of current market conditions derived from Minara’s continuous data analysis.

### Core Features

The market view generated by Minara AI is presented through two dynamic leaderboards:

* **Bullish Board** — tokens with upward potential in the short-to-mid term.
* **Bearish Board** — tokens with increasing downside risk, also in the short-to-mid term.

Each board is continually refreshed and ranked based on a multi-factor model combining volatility, liquidity, technical signals, and sentiment data.

The ultimate goal is to help users position before upside moves and exit before sharp declines wherever possible. Fundamentally, Crypto Picks **identifies the near-term direction of price movement** with explainable, data-backed signals.

### Token Selections

All featured tokens are the result of Minara’s **data-driven selection process**, which evaluates each token using the following components:

* **Market and Technical Signals**
  * **Volatility & Drawdown:** 30-day rolling volatility and maximum drawdown to estimate stability.
  * **Liquidity & Depth:** Trading volume, liquidity, and turnover rate.
  * **Momentum Indicators:** MA, EMA, RSI, ATR, funding-rate shifts, and structural breakouts.
* **On-Chain and Capital Flow**&#x20;
  * **Whale Transactions:** Identifies large transfers or address clusters influencing short-term liquidity.
  * **Exchange Inflows/Outflows:** Tracks net fund movement between CEXs and on-chain wallets to infer accumulation or distribution.
  * **Token Holder Dynamics:** Monitors long-term holders and active address changes.
* **Fundamental and News Factors**
  * **Project Fundamentals:** Ecosystem activity, development progress, major upgrades, or tokenomics changes.
  * **Event and Sentiment Catalysts:** Integrate recent news tone and market reactions to policy or macro events.

Each token receives a **directional probability** (bullish or bearish) and a **confidence score** indicating Minara’s conviction in that outlook.

### History

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/图片 (64).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### **What appears in History**

Tokens removed from either board within the past **7 days**, with:

* **Status at Removal:** Price / Target at removal
* **Reason for Removal:** provided by Minara AI. Typical reasons including:
  * _Target reached_ (objective met)
  * _Trend ended_ (structure break, momentum exhausted)
  * _Reversal detected_ (direction flip)
  * _Material adverse/positive event_ (e.g., major delist, exploit, policy shock)
* **Since Listing Performance:** highest/lowest vs. initial tracked price
* **Tracking Window:** Timestamp for the tracking window

#### **Re-entry policy**

* A previously removed token can reappear if a **new valid setup** forms.
* At market turning points, a token may be **removed from one board and simultaneously added to the other**, reflecting a clear reversal in trend.
* Re-entry is treated as a **fresh listing**: new Tracked Price, new Target, new Confidence, new “Tracking since”.

***

### Personalization

Users can adjust their **Risk Preference** (Low / Medium / High).

* **Low:** Large-cap, lower-volatility tokens.
* **Medium:** Balanced exposure.
* **High:** Smaller-cap, high-volatility tokens with stronger short-term potential.

This setting reorders tokens within each board according to their risk–return characteristics.
