# Getting Started

This guide walks you through gaining access to the Minara Agent API and managing your API keys.

### Plan & Permissions

The Minara Agent API is available exclusively to **Pro** and **Partner** plan users.

If you are on a free plan, navigate to the `API` tab in your profile to see the upgrade prompt. Once upgraded, you can generate and manage API keys.

> **Note:** If you downgrade your subscription, all active API keys will be automatically paused. They will resume automatically when you renew.

### Creating an API Key

1. Go to your **Account Profile** at [minara.ai](https://minara.ai).
2. Select the **API Key** tab from the left menu, and click **Create**

3. Once created, your API key will be displayed. **Copy and store it securely—the full key is only shown once** (You can also download a `.txt` file backup).
