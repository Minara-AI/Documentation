## Why We build Minara?

With AI and blockchain technologies maturing—and the [GENIUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GENIUS_Act) and [CLARITY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarity_Act) Acts being passed—**we’re entering an era where everyone can take part in next-gen digital finance.**

We define next-gen digital finance as a 24/7 global open financial network, with the following core pillars:

1. **Stablecoins** as the main currency for global trade,
2. **Public** **blockchains** as the core infrastructure for asset transfers,
3. **Tokens and NFTs** as standard formats for both digital-native and real-world assets (RWA),
4. **DeFi protocols** as the foundation for open, smart contract-based investment products.
5. **AI will serve as a 24/7 wealth manager,** assisting humans in partial or full asset management.

A typical user story is shown below:

In the past 5 years, digital finance is growing fast—but it’s also getting more complex. On-chain ecosystems evolve rapidly, while crypto wallets are still clunky and hard to use. This keeps the entry barrier high for newcomers. We believe the current tools aren’t enough to onboard the next wave of users.

That's why Minara is here: **we need a brand new AI interface that replaces complexity with chatting and brings everyone into the digital finance—regardless of background or skill.**
