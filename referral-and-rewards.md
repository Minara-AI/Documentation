# Referral & Rewards

### Step by Step Guide

1. **Get your invite link**\
   You’ll find them in the **Invites** section of your profile.
2. **Share with friends**\
   Send your link or code to people who haven’t joined Minara yet.\
   When they register their account using your invite, it counts as a referral.
3. **Earn rewards**\
   You receive **Credits and Sparks** automatically base on the action of your invitees. (See “Reward Details” below for more details.)
4. **Track your progress**\
   See your total invites, paid conversions, and rewards at a glance in your **Profile** - **Invites**.

### Reward Tiers

Minara’s referral program uses a tiered reward system, and your rewards as an inviter increase as you bring more users to Minara.

Each tier is determined by the **total number of invitees** who have successfully signed up through your link.

Inviter rewards vary by tier and are granted when an invitee purchases a **paid plan for the first time**.

<table><thead><tr><th width="152">Tier</th><th>Inviter Reward</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Frist 10 Invites</td><td><p><strong>Signup Reward:</strong> 200 Credits for each signup</p><p></p><p><strong>First Purchase Reward:</strong></p><ul><li>300 Credits</li><li>50% of the Sparks your invitee receives from their first paid plan</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>11 to 50 Invites</td><td><p><strong>Signup Reward:</strong> None</p><p></p><p><strong>First Purchase Reward:</strong></p><ul><li>400 Credits</li><li>60% of the Sparks your invitee receives from their first paid plan</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Above 50 invites</td><td><p><strong>Signup Reward:</strong> None</p><p></p><p><strong>First Purchase Reward:</strong></p><ul><li>500 Credits</li><li>70% of the Sparks your invitee receives from their first paid plan</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Invitee rewards remain the same:** every invitee receives extra **200 Credits** upon signup.
{% endhint %}

The reward inviter receives is determined at the moment when a reward-triggering event occurs.

This means:

* If you have **11 signups** when one of your early invitees pays for their first time,\
  → you receive **Tier 2 rewards (400 Credits + 60% Sparks)** for that payment.
* If you have **51 signups** at that time,\
  → you receive **Tier 3 rewards (500 Credits + 70% Sparks)**.

> _Credits_ can be used across Minara’s features. Learn more about credits in [how-credits-work.md](subscription-and-credits/how-credits-work.md "mention") \
> &#xNAN;_&#x53;parks_ are special bonuses for limited events. Check out [spark.md](features/spark.md "mention") for more details

### 💬 FAQs

**Q1. Do I keep my rewards even if my plan has expired?**\
Yes. Earned Credits and Sparks remain in your account.

**Q2. How is the Sparks bonus split?**\
Your friend receives the full Sparks bonus based on their plan (as normal), and you receive 50 % of the amount they receive.

**Q3. Do reward credits expire?**

Reward credits do not expire. Credits are used in the following order whenever you spend them:

1. **Plan Credits** – your plan credits that refresh every month;
2. **Reward Credits** – credits you earn from referral rewards;
3. **Top-up Credits** – credits you purchase manually as add-ons.

Please note that rewards are only granted for the **invitee’s first paid subscription.** If you didn't receive rewards correctly, please submit a ticket in our Discord.
