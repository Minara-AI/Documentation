### Key Features

* **Real-Time Insights:** Access powerful, real-time data across crypto and stocks to make faster, better-informed decisions. Wallet tracking, DeFi features, and alpha-hunting capabilities — ready to be orchestrated by agents out of the box.
* **Trading Suggestions**: Minara analyzes the current market conditions and returns direct long/short suggestions, along with preset order setups you can execute immediately. It's designed to shorten the loop from “what’s happening?” to “place the trade.”
* **Text-to-Swap:** Describe your trading intent in plain English, and Minara converts it quickly and accurately into an executable on-chain transaction payload. By default, it’s compatible with OKX DEX, so you can route swaps with minimal friction.

### How It Works

The API offers two primary methods for access and billing:

1. **API Key** — Available with a **Pro or Partner** plan. Generate keys directly from your Minara profile.
2. **Pay-As-You-Go** — A flexible, permissionless option via the [x402 protocol](https://www.x402.org/), allowing usage-based payments with stablecoins like $USDC.
