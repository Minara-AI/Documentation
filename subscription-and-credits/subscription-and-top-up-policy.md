# Subscription & Top-up Policy

***

### &#x20;Subscription & Billing

* Subscription fees are **charged upfront** and are **non-refundable** unless legally required or explicitly stated otherwise.
* Subscriptions **automatically renew** at the end of each billing cycle unless downgraded to the free plan.

***

### Changing Plans

#### &#x20;Upgrading

* Upgrading means switching from a lower-tier plan to a higher-tier one.
* The upgrade takes effect **immediately after payment completed**.
* After successful payment for the new plan, Minara will **refund the unused portion** of your current plan to your original payment method.



**Example:**

> You subscribed to the **Starter Plan ($49)** on May 1 and upgraded to the **Partner Plan ($199)** on June 5, with **1000 credits remaining** out of 2600.\
> The refund would be:
>
> `($49 × 1000) ÷ 2600 = $18.84`

_(Rounded down to two decimal places.)_

***

#### Downgrading

* Downgrading means switching from a higher-tier plan to a lower-tier one.
* Downgrades take effect **at the start of the next billing cycle**. Your current plan will remain active until expiration.

### Top-up Credits Pack

#### Purchase Rules

* You can purchase a credit top-up only when you are on a **paid subscription plan** and have **consumed all your current credits**.

#### Usage Rules

1. Top-up credits will only be used after your subscription credits are **fully consumed**.
2. Top-up credits are only available while an **active subscription** is in place.
3. Top-up credits do not replace subscription credits—they are supplementary.

**Example Scenarios:**

* On **June 28**, your subscription credits run out. You purchase a top-up. → Now you're using top-up credits.
* On **June 29**, your subscription expires. → Now you switch to the **Free Plan**. **Top-up credits are unavailable.**
* You use up the free credits (if you have any). → Top-up credits still cannot be used unless a paid subscription is reactivated.
* On **July 1**, you subscribe again. → **Top-up credits are preserved** and remain active, but will only be used after the new plan’s credits fully consumed.

***
