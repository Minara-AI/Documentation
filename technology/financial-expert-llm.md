# Financial Expert LLM

Minara is powered by the [DMind](https://dmind.ai/) series of finance-native expert models, which serve as the backbone for data structuring, analysis, and high-precision summarization.

By pairing DMind LLM with **state-of-the-art** industry LLMs like Claude and GPT, Minara delivers best-in-class financial multi-agent systems in the space.

This architecture enables our agents to collaborate, reason, and execute across the full spectrum of digital finance—research, analysis, decision-making, and on-chain/off-chain execution—at a level that outperforms generic AI models by a wide margin.
