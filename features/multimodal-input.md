# Multimodel Input

Minara now supports **multimodal input:** users can upload images and files directly when chatting with Minara.

Upload supported file types such as **images**, **Excel sheets**, and **PDF documents** alongside your prompt to get richer insights, automated summaries, and data-driven answers without switching between tools.

> **Single file limit:** up to _10 MB_\
> **Max files amount per upload:** _5 files_

#### 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload Files**\
   Drag and drop or select files when composing your prompt. You can upload up to _5 files at once_ (each ≤ _10 MB_).
2. **Describe Your Task**\
   Add a question or instruction in natural language — e.g., _“Summarize key insights from this report”_ or _“Analyze this Excel dataset and tell me the top trends.”_
3. **Minara Reads & Responds**\
   Minara integrates text, visual elements, and structured data to produce a unified answer — extracting tables, interpreting charts, or summarizing text.

#### 📎 Example Scenarios

> Below are some typical usage scenarios for multimodal input. Users are free to explore this feature beyond these examples.
>
> For a better experience and more thorough multimodal analysis, we recommend enabling **Quality mode** during the conversation.

**📈 Image-Based Chart Review**

Users uploadd candlestick chart screenshots, either raw or with their own annotations such as trend lines, arrows, support/resistance levels, or text notes.

For raw charts, Minara analyzes the price structure directly and identifies key support and resistance zones. When annotations are present, Minara interprets the visual signals and evaluates whether the user’s analysis logic is reasonable, highlighting confirmations, invalidation conditions, and context-aware trading insights.

**📰 Tweet / News Screenshot Fact Check**

Users uploads screenshots of tweets or news articles.

For tweets, minara analyzes visible signals such as handle patterns, verification status, follower structure, and content characteristics to identify potential scam or high-risk accounts.

For news articles, minara extracts key information such as source, author, timestamp, and main claims, and helps assess credibility, missing context, or potential misinterpretation.

***

**📊 Excel Data Analysis**

Users uploads Excel or CSV files containing trading records or datasets.

Minara interprets the structure, analyzes performance and behavior patterns, summarizes profit and loss drivers, and provides personalized improvement suggestions.

***

**📄 PDF Insights & Summaries**

Users uploads project whitepapers or reports in PDF format.

Minara summarizes core positioning, evaluates technical feasibility, token necessity, team credibility, roadmap clarity, and highlights key risks in a structured way.

#### 🧠 Tips for Best Results

* **Combine text + files:** Provide clear instructions with your upload
* **Multiple files context:** You can upload several related files at once (e.g., an image and an Excel) and ask cross-document questions.
* **Clean data helps:** Well-formatted spreadsheets or scanned PDFs with clear text yield better extraction and interpretation.
