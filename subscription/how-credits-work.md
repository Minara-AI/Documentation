# How credits work?

### When Are Credits Deducted?

Credits are deducted when a message or task is completed or manually stopped. Including:

1. Regular chats with Minara
2. Deep Research report generation
3. Workflow creation and execution (applicable to specific nodes)

If a response or task is interrupted due to a system error, **no credits will be deducted**.



### Typical Usage Examples

> **Note:** The values below are estimated averages for reference only. Actual credit usage varies per action and is calculated based on the number of tokens used.

| **Action**        | **Est. Average Cost Per Action** |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Messaging         | \~20 Credits                     |
| Deep Research     | \~50 Credits                     |
| Workflow Creation | \~5 Credits                      |



### Workflow Execution Rules

For now, credits are deducted only for Minara Call nodes.

| **Node Type** | **Credit Usage**            |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Monitor       | Currently free              |
| Trade         | Free                        |
| Notify        | Currently free              |
| Minara Call   | Based on actual tokens used |



### **Need More Credits?**

Credits are refreshed monthly at the beginning of your plan cycle. You can upgrade your plan (which takes effect immediately) or purchase a Top-Up pack (available only with an active subscription) at any time to keep things running smoothly.



Enjoy your time with Minara!
