# Vibe Trading

## Overview

Minara is committed to bringing every people into the world of blockchain.

* People can manually trade tokens directly within the chat interface, guided by Minara’s insights and suggestions;
* People can execute trades or set up agentic strategies **using prompts** — no coding required.

With Minara, you can use stablecoins like **$USDC** to trade any on-chain assets—cryptocurrency, tokenized stocks, RWAs, NFTs—and interact seamlessly with DeFi protocols.

This opens the door for billions of new users and fresh capital to enter the world of finance. More importantly, it gives common people the chance to grow their wealth the way professional traders do.
