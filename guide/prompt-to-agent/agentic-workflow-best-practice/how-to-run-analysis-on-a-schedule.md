# How to run analysis on a schedule

Whether it’s weekly market health checks, monthly portfolio reviews, or periodic strategy evaluations, this workflow keeps you in the loop consistently.

### Best Practice

* Choose a reasonable frequency — avoid unnecessarily high-frequency checks to save credits.
* Clearly specify the **topics (e.g. assets**, **metrics**, and **indicators)** you want in the analysis.
* Use consistent scheduling patterns (e.g., every Friday, 9 AM) for easier tracking.
* Email is recommended for long analysis reports and telegram is more suitable for shorter messages.

### Example Prompts

1. **Weekly market health check** — Every Friday at 10:00 AM, analyze global crypto market cap trends, BTC/ETH dominance, and top DeFi protocol activity.
2. **Monthly asset performance review** — On the 1st of every month at 9:00 AM, pull the 30-day price change, trading volume, and on-chain activity for my top 5 holdings.
3. **Long-term target tracking** — Every Friday at 8:00 AM, evaluate the market using all bull- and bear-market top indicators and send a summary to my email.
4. **Ecosystem watch** — Every Monday at 11:00 AM, review Solana’s top 10 active projects by daily wallet interaction growth.
5. **Sector rotation signal** — Every 2 weeks, compare performance of L1s, L2s, and DeFi tokens, and suggest a rebalance strategy.

### Future Developments

* Integration with more **data sources** for richer, multi-domain analysis.
