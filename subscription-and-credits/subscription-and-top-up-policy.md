# Subscription & Top-up Policy

***

### &#x20;Subscription & Billing

* Subscription fees are **charged upfront** and are **non-refundable** unless legally required or explicitly stated otherwise.
* Subscriptions **automatically renew** at the end of each billing cycle unless downgraded to the free plan.

***

### Changing Plans

#### &#x20;Upgrading

* Upgrading refers to switching from a lower-tier subscription plan to a higher-tier one.
* The upgrade takes effect **immediately** after **payment is completed**.
* **Your current billing cycle remains unchanged** — the renewal date stays the same as your original subscription.
* You will only be charged the **price difference** between the new plan and your existing plan.
* Your **credits will be added** based on the new plan’s allocation, while keeping the same expiry date.

**Example:**

> You subscribed to the **Starter Plan ($49)** on **May 1**, and decided to upgrade to the **Partner Plan ($199)** on **May 10**. \
> You will be charged: $199 - $49 = $150
>
> After the payment, your plan is upgraded to Partner immediately, and your subscription still renews on **June 1**.&#x20;
>
> This amount of credits are added to your account: 41500-2600= 38900

***

#### Downgrading

* Downgrading means switching from a higher-tier plan to a lower-tier one.
* Downgrades take effect **at the start of the next billing cycle**. Your current plan will remain active until expiration.

***

### Cross-Plan Switching Rules

| From \ To         | Plan Tier              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Monthly → Monthly | ✅ Any plan             |
| Yearly → Yearly   | ✅ Any plan             |
| Monthly → Yearly  | ✅ Equivalent or higher |
| Yearly → Monthly  | ❌ Not yet supported    |

***

### Top-up Credits Pack

#### Purchase Rules

* You can purchase a credit top-up only when you are on a **paid subscription plan** and have **consumed all your current credits**.

#### Usage Rules

1. Top-up credits will only be used after your subscription credits are **fully consumed**.
2. Top-up credits are only available while an **active subscription** is in place.
3. Top-up credits do not replace subscription credits—they are supplementary.

**Example Scenarios:**

* On **June 28**, your subscription credits run out. You purchase a top-up. → Now you're using top-up credits.
* On **June 29**, your subscription expires. → Now you switch to the **Free Plan**. **Top-up credits are unavailable.**
* You use up the free credits (if you have any). → Top-up credits still cannot be used unless a paid subscription is reactivated.
* On **July 1**, you subscribe again. → **Top-up credits are preserved** and remain active, but will only be used after the new plan’s credits fully consumed.

* No refunds are issued for:
