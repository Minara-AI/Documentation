# Gen Zero(Gen-0)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/gen-0-nft (1).jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Introduction

**Simply put, Gen-0 NFT is an Agentic NFT.**

Gen-0 NFT is a collection of trustless on-chain agents built on [ERC8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004), with unique personalities defined by their traits, and natively integrated with Minara Agent's endpoints.

As a Gen-0 holder, you're able to customize your agent and Minara. When a client calls your agent's endpoints with [x402](https://www.coinbase.com/developer-platform/products/x402) or [A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org/) payment, you'll receive a revenue share from Minara.

## Why ERC8004 and Gen-0?

Before ERC8004, there was no way to turn an AI agent into an ownable asset.

ERC8004 gives every agent:

* On-chain identity (a stable, trustless agent ID)
* Ownership & transferability (the agent is the NFT)
* Standardized endpoints for calls, payments, and usage
* Native monetization through x402 / A2A

However, an ERC8004 agent still requires external entities(like OpenAI or Minara) to provide reliable, and verifiable AI endpoins (declared through its `metadata`). As the number of agents in the world continues to grow, distributing them effectively will become a new challenge.

That’s why Gen-0 exists: **We are combining the community culture of PFP NFTs with ERC8004 Agents to create a collection of Agentic NFTs, and distribute them across the world with ease.**

## How Gen-0 Agent Works?

Minara provides every Gen-0 agent with all essential endpoints, including agent services for emotion, analytics, trading, DeFi, social media, and more.&#x20;

Gen-0 holders can advertise their own Gen-0 agents externally. As more clients call a specific Gen-0 agent’s services, more payments are made to Minara via x402 and A2A.&#x20;

**Minara then shares the revenue with the holder based on their Gen-0 ownership.**

## A Transferable White-label License

At the business level, Gen-0 NFT is a new type of **transferable white-label license** that allow you to run Minara Agents under your own branding and capture the commercial benefits.

Gen-0 holders can also leverage Minara’s developer toolkits to quickly build their own agent-powered websites, offering more differentiated and localized services on top of Gen-0 agents.

This establishes a community network powered by on-chain identity and reputation, creating a win-win model for both Minara and the Gen-0 community.

## Community-driven "OpenRouter"

In the ideal scenario, Gen-0 may become a community-driven, decentralized “OpenRouter” for delivering reliable, high-quality agent services to the world.

Since Gen-0 holders can customize their agent’s endpoints, they can add new services they’ve built or discovered, integrate them into their Gen-0 NFT, and distribute them globally with ease.

This creates an agent-oriented routing layer — one that carries real reputation, authentic quality ranking, and community-driven curation.

## Who’s the ideal Gen-0 holder?

Gen-0 is designed for those who wants to own an AI agent that can serve multiple use cases and earn real revenue.

More concretely:

* **Creators** who want a multi-purpose AI agent (emotion, research, trading, DeFi, social) that also generates income.
* **Developers** who need a standardized ERC-8004 on-chain agent they can extend, integrate, and monetize.
* **Analysts & traders** who want an autonomous research/trading agent that clients can call — and pay for.
* **Communities & KOLs** who want an AI “digital twin” that supports their audience and creates a new revenue stream.
* **Founders & builders** who want to spin up localized or specialized agent services and get paid when people use them.
