# Tools Integration

## Overview

Currently, Minara integrates the following external tools, including various data sources from the financial and crypto sectors, as well as Minara team's private data and knowledge base.

## Date Source

Minara does not rely on web search for actionable insights, **as they're often unreliable.** Instead, Minara opted to integrate various industry data sources, covering the following categories:

* **Finance Data**: transactions, stocks, tokens, DeFi, NFTs, liquidation, project/VC information, etc
* **Audience Data**: entities, holders, smart money, social identities, P\&L, relationships, etc
* **Sentiment Data**: news, X posts and trends, Greed/Fear index, macro signals, policy headlines, etc

These data are sourced from **50+** leading industry data and sentiment providers, including:
