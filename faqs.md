# FAQs

### Getting Started with Minara**n**

#### **1. How should I ask questions to Minara?**

Open the chat window with Minara, and you can type any question or request just like talking to a friend—no complicated commands required. For example:

* "Help me analyze this KOL @elonmusk"
* "Is it a good time to buy ETH now?"
* "Buy $100 ETH for me."

Minara understands context and supports continuous dialogue. You can even use simplified expressions like “buy $10 more” or “cancel the last order.” Whether it’s technical analysis, market research, or direct trading execution, everything can be done in one sentence.

#### **2. What can Minara help me with?**

Minara can assist you throughout the entire process, from data analysis and decision-making to on-chain execution. You can ask Minara nearly any question related to Web3, such as:

* "What token should I buy now?"
* "Analyze trader James Wynn’s strategy and motives"
* "What's the crypto market trend for the next month?"
* "Should I buy the dip or sell my BTC now?"
* "Execute a trade for me directly"

Minara responds quickly and executes precisely. Additionally, Minara's built-in **DeepResearch** module can perform multi-stage reasoning and generate detailed, beautiful research reports on complex topics, like "Compare the technical architecture and development potential of Solana and Sui."

Minara also supports **Prompt-to-Agent**, enabling you to create automated workflows (e.g., monitor on-chain transactions and trigger actions) through simple dialogue with Minara, and manage them through a visual interface.

### Trading & Asset Management

#### **1. What types of assets and chains does Minara support?**

Minara currently supports major chains such as Solana, Ethereum, Base, BSC, Arbitrum, and Optimism, with plans to expand its ecosystem coverage. Whether you want to quickly enter a trending token or need refined strategy execution, Minara is here to help—just ask!

#### **2.Does Minara support cross-chain trading?**

Yes. You can use assets on one chain (e.g., USDC, USDT) to purchase tokens on another chain (including meme coins). Minara automatically handles cross-chain transfers without the need for manual bridging or network switching—it's simple and efficient.

#### **3. What types of trades does Minara support?**

Currently, Minara supports:

* **Spot trading**
  * Supported order types: market orders and stop market orders.
* **Custom strategy trading based on workflows**
  * Example: copy trading by address, split entry and exit, etc.

Future support will include:

* Futures trading
* Automated arbitrage/wealth management
* Structured DeFi product integration
* Other advanced features

#### **4. How does Minara handle failed or erroneous trades?**

Minara uses a multi-layer security mechanism to ensure transaction reliability and fund safety. Before execution, critical parameters like account balance, gas fees, and slippage settings are automatically checked. During execution, if network congestion or price volatility occurs, Minara will intelligently adjust gas fees and retry automatically. If a trade ultimately fails, the system will provide a detailed error analysis and suggestions. All operations are logged, so you can easily track execution status and avoid worrying about funds being stuck.

#### **5. Will Minara execute trades without authorization?**

Minara strictly adheres to the security principle of **“user authorization first.”** Minara will never execute any trade without your explicit consent. Each trade requires your confirmation, and large transactions will trigger a secondary confirmation. For automated strategies (e.g., copy trading, DCA), Minara will only execute once you’ve explicitly set and activated them. You can pause, modify, or stop these strategies at any time.

#### **6. Where can I view and track my trades and activity history?**

You can track your trades and activities by clicking **“Asset - Activity”** to view your transaction history and account activity.

#### **7. Does Minara support manual intervention in trading strategies?**

Minara's design philosophy is "AI automation + human control." You have full control over all trading strategies. Whether it's an active automated strategy or a limited order, you can pause, modify parameters, or stop them at any time. This flexible control mechanism ensures you enjoy AI efficiency while maintaining decision-making authority at critical moments.

#### **8. What wallet solution is Minara based on? Is it safe?**

One major advantage of Minara is that it creates a custodial smart wallet for each user. You don’t have to hold gas tokens (like $ETH or $SOL) or learn how multi-chain crypto wallets work—Minara simplifies it for you.\
Unlike traditional centralized exchanges, this custodial smart wallet is not stored in Minara's internal database but is an on-chain smart contract wallet. Minara can manage the funds in this wallet but cannot hide, delete, or blacklist it. Customizing wallet management will be supported in the future.\

#### **2. What if my credit card deposit fails?**

Minara integrates multiple OTC payment channels, but due to policy restrictions and bank risk controls in different countries or regions, credit card payments may fail.
